   The following are the Open issues that have been closed over the last 5 days.
   We now have Steve Giron working triaging the bugs. He has gone through all open bugs (>90) and
   closed bugs where the
      1) problem is now fixed,
      2) closed the bugs if they were trivial (with the original users input), or
      3) we actually know we fixed the bug (you would see dan or gil as commenting on bug) or
      4) We document that it is not a bug but is performing as it was designed.
      5) Bug closed because it is a duplicate of another bug
   If you see an issue closed that you think is still an issue, please re-open the issue.

4.0.30  May 13, 2015
  NOTES FROM DEVELOPMENT
   (Dkulp) * Detect ramp up/down when converting to effects
   (Dkulp) * IF the effects panels are disabled (for example, while rendering and saving),
      we cannot update the effect as disabling the controls changes the effect strings.
   (Gil) * Draw Timing lines last. This makes a timing grid look better when selecting 25,50ms.
   (Gil) * Use original effect duration for paste if no timing track is active.
   (dkulp) * Fix problem of "To Center" checkbox on text always being turned off
   (dkulp) * Add the alpha channel handling to text effect
   (dkulp) * Re-render range when effect moves
   (dkulp) * More slider<->text updates. Dan is adding text boxes to all effects that have sliders. This allows entering exact values

   -enh (dkulp) Modify F3 so that effects like morph can try to work.
    -enh (djulien) Allow option to continue Preview playback if channel data is missing from .xseq file (helps avoid the need to re-render everything if you've added props at the end)
    -enh (djulien) Default Brightness to 100% if setting not present in XML file (only affects externally generated XML files)
    -enh (djulien) show elapsed time on file loads
    -bug (djulien) Fixed Wave effect when rendered in a .xseq (FillColor was not selected, which resulted in no output)
3.6.14 Dec 17, 2014
    -enh (djulien) Add collapse/expand button (located next to "Create Random Effects")
      to allow more grid space on laptops
    -enh (djulien) Add "My Display" and "Brightness" columns to Preview model CSV - makes it easier to see why a prop is not getting any data. 8/
    -bug (djulien) Avoid "error 0" when exporting CSV of Preview models.  Show correct value for "start channel#".
    -enh (gjones) Update On effect to have 3 color sliders, associated text fields, and bitmap showing selected color.
                  The bitmap button can be used to select the color which will update the sliders and text fields.
    -bug (dkulp) Should not be able to select fseq for model export, only eseq
    -bug (dkulp) On OSX only, could not open notes and map files that used txt extensions.
    -enh (gjones) Add On effect.  This effect simply allows you to turn on all pixels in a model to the selected color.
    -bug (gjones) Remove extraneous whitespace from the LMS filetype in the drop-down on the file select dialog when
                  selecting a file to convert.
    -bug (dkulp) Use cos/sin/radians/etc... to render circles effect.  Removes some extra noise.
    -enh (dkulp) When loading a sequence on Nutcracker tab, reset flags so you don't also need to re-load it on Preview pane
3.6.13 Dec 9, 2014

3.6.12 Dec 5, 2014
    -bug (dkulp) If Column 1 renders really fast, it could hang on save due to Thread 2 waiting for
      information from thread 1 which is already gone. This could cause hangs on save.
    -bug (dkulp) Fix some thread safety issues in RenderCircle, RenderText, RenderPicture. This would have muged the effects.
    -test (dkulp) Try flipping to a busy wait for TextEffect rendering to see if that prevents some crashes/hangs
    -enh (dkulp) RenderPictures now has a 20FPS check box so rendering can just advance per frame if the movie is already in 20fps.
      If unchecked, the "Speed" slider adjusts the speed (with 10 being "normal", <10 slower, >10 faster). A speed of 10 = 20fps.
3.6.11 Dec 4, 2014
    -enh (dkulp) Add a "Settings" menu.  First setting: ability to disable the multi-threaded saves.
         When disable, all is rendered on the main thread.  Slower, but maybe safer.
         With this change, there are now four ways to save
         1) Normal - threaded
         2) Normal + Fast Save - threaded but only rendering the stuff that has changed
         3) Threading disabled (settings menu) - all rendering is on the main thread, one column at a time.
         4) Threading disabled + fast save - all rendering is on the main thread,
            one column at a time, but starting with the top left most changed cell.
    -bug (dkulp) When "Play" hits the bottom of the grid, the "Stop" button wasn't changed back to "Play"
   -bug (sean) Ripple effect was not calculating corners correctly
   -enh (sean) Added thickness slider and 3D button to Ripple.
3.6.10   Dec 3, 2014
   -bug (sean) Added missing xLights.ico file. You should see icon in tray now
   -bug (sean) "Create Random Effects"Would create None,None about 20% of time. This is now fixed.
   -bug (sean) Ripple was not rendering to PREVIEW screen or to actual lights. fixed
   -bug (dkulp) If "Save" is clicked multiple times real quick, it could hang/crash as it tries to save/render things at the same time.
         Fixed by disabling the Save buttons while saving.
   -bug (dkulp) Insert row inserting two rows, not one
   -bug (dkulp) On the MAC, the clipboard sometimes used \r instead of \n.
      (From Numbers for example) Update the paste to the grid to accommodate that.
   -enh (dkulp) Change the "Play (F4)" button in the NUTCRACKER tab to be a Play/Stop toggle.
3.6.9   Nov 29, 2014
    -bug (dkulp) Move Text effect rendering back to main thread due GDI calls it makes (to get Font info and to
      render the text) which is required to be done on the main thread.
    -bug (dkulp) Custom models that don't have an element in the grid for all channels in the range would cause
      buffer overruns on ModelExport
    -bug (dkulp) ModelExport was not using the SettingsMap to determine the state of the "Persistent" checkbox
      and instead looked at the actual checkbox on the page.
    -enh (dkulp) MAC - turn off anti-aliased text rendering to make it match Windows (and look better)
    -bug (dkulp) Model Export was crashing, now fixed.
3.6.8   Nov 28, 2014
   -enh (sean) Modified install program so that it has an auto launch button for Windows installs
    -enh (mbrown) Removed check that number of Renard channels is a multiple of 8.
    -enh (dkulp) Add ability to ignore LOR channels that do not have a deviceType and network defined. (common
                  for beat tracks and unused channels.

   -enh (dpitts) Added Preview Groups into PREVIEW tab, Create a group, when you select that group the
         "Part of My Display" will be set automatically for you. This allows you to set groups of models and be
         able to turn on the "Part of My Display"
    -bug (dkulp) Fix a bug where the LastChannelCount always assumed RGB nodes
    -bug (dkulp) On Mac, could not paste stuff into custom model due to using \r instead of \n for line delimiter
    -enh (dkulp) SPEED: Multi-thread the Nutcracker tab saving to speed up the rendering/saving
    -enh (dkulp) SPEED: Change the internal representation of a color to avoid some unnecessary OS calls.  Results in
                  significantly faster rendering of effects.
    -enh (dkulp) SPEED: Add "Fast Save" option on Nutcracker tab to allow the save command to only render the cells below
                  and to the right of the cells that have changed.  Placing the models you are working on to the
                  right on the grid can significantly speed up turn around time if you flip between Preview and
                  Nutcracker often.
    -bug (dkulp) Fix bug in SingelStrand chase effect that could cause a crash/memory corruption if used on
                  models with more than 1000 nodes.  (like whole house)
    -bug (dkulp) Fix a crash that would occur if the image effect was used, but no image was available.
    -bug (dkulp) Column  Shift left/right now copies cell protection.
3.6.7   Nov 23, 2014
   -bug (djulien) scrunch UI so it will fit on a laptop (needs to be < 760 px high)
    -bug (dkulp) Fix Rendering of Ripple effect during save, now shows up in PREVIEW and lights
    -bug (dkulp) Fix Rendering of Strobe effect during save, now shows up in PREVIEW and lights
3.6.6   Nov 22, 2014

         could not select items. fixed.
   -enh (cpinkham) Add 'Pixelnet-Open' Network Type for Pixelnet output using Generic FTDI chipset USB to RS485 dongles.
   -enh (dkulp) During conversions, buffer non-critical updates to the messages list and append
      to the list box in blocks of about 10K.   Significantly speeds up conversions for HLS and LOR
      with very large files that display a lot of messages.
3.6.5   Nov 20, 2014
   -enh (sean) New effect class , Strobe.
   -enh (sean) Icons on top of each effect improved. This icons will be what you drag and drop effects in xLights 4.0. This early introduction
      is to help familiarize users with the icons to an effect.
   -bug (frankr) Non music sequences would freeze preview play. fixed
   -enh (djulien) Add Papagayo option for scaled vs. fixed picture mode
   -enh (djulien) Allow Papagayo grid row labels to be aliased (click on row label to change it); cosmetic only - does not change xml file
   -bug (djulien) Avoid "error 0" after writing new Papagayo file
    -bug (dkulp) SingleLine models with multiple string bug one node per string were displayed as a single light
    -bug (dkulp) Rotating single lines would cause the number of lights to display to drop by 2. (lose the ends)
    -enh (dkulp) Added pixel level "Skips" effect to SingleStrand effects.
    -enh (dkulp) Add ability to shift columns in the grid left or right to reorder them.
    -enh (dkulp) If the effect is NONE and the buffer is already clear, skip clearing it.  For large Whole House models, clearing the
                buffer can take time so skip it if we can.
    -bug (dkulp)  If the preview is too large for the viewport such that part of the preview was cut off
                at the top, clicking wasn't adjusting the Y coordinate to compensate when determining what
                was being clicked on.
3.6.4   Nov 12, 2014
   -bug (frankr) Fixed playback issue. If you play a sequence in the PREVIEW tab, stop, go and edit some effects in the NUYTCRACKER tab,
         press save and then go back to the PREVIEW tab, xlights would freeze up. This should be fixed now
   -enh (frankr) improvements to audio scrubbing and better handling of stop now button on
   -bug (frankr) When first entering teh PREVIEW tab , if you right click and select model xlights crashed. Fixed.
   -enh (sean) New effect "Off". This effect is the equivalent of "Colorwash, 1color=BLACK"
   -enh (sean) When saving a sequence the elapsed time for the save is now shown in the bottom status line.
   -enh (sean) New favicons have been added to the left most corner of Effects. The purpose of these is to have a graphical
         representation of effects. This is pre work for the new xlights 4.0 coming early next year. In xlights 4, effects will
         be dropped onto horizontal timelines, for for each model.
    -bug (dkulp) OSX - selecting cells on the Nutcracker grid was not updating the colours on the palette buttons
    -bug (dkulp) On OSX Yosemite, the Font dialogue for the text effect would cause a crash.
   -bug (dkulp) sometimes xlights would crash when you selected multiple objects and then right clicked to the alignment menu. Fixed

3.6.3   Nov 11, 2014
    -bug (dkulp) Fix problem of stars using a single RGB node per concentric layer not displaying correctly.
   -enh (sean) Moved "Create Whole House Model" button to be higher on the screen. This helps people with lower
      resolution computers.
   -enh (sean) reformatted Pinwheel screen so that it does not take as much screen to draw form.
3.6.2   Nov 7, 2014
    -enh (dkulp) Tree360 and Tree270 can now specify which strand to use for the first column when exporting and individual model.
                    This allows the exported models to work around issues with the 12:00 first strand for Nutcracker but the first
                    strand is expected to be the 9:00 position in HLS.
   -enh (frankr) New play,pause,stop buttons in PREVIEW screen. Moving the slider plays sequence data and plays sound,
      Move it to place where you want to start. Press PLAY, sequence starts from there. STOP button resets sequence to 0:0.0
   -enh (dpitts) New feature to select multiple objects in the PREVIEW window. 1st) Click and select first object that will be used
      as baseline. 2nd) Hold the shift key down and draw a rectangle. Any objects that fall within the rectangle will be selected.
      3rd) Right click and select how you want the selected objects to be aligned (Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Horizontal Center,
         Vertical Center). If items are stretched out horizontally, use Top/Bottom. If item are stretched out vertically, use
         Left/Right.
         A group that is highlighted in yellow can be moved anywhere on the screen, hold the ctrl key down before moving.
         Note: A highlighted group cannot be sized or rotated. That will be added in a future release.
      NOTE: If you screw something up, exit without saving and come back in. Later we will add an undo key.
      NOTE2: If you have been editing your preview and it looks good, do a Save on the preview screen. Also do a "File,Backup".
      This will save your current preview work AND make a copy of it in the Backup subdirectory.
3.6.1   Nov 6,2014
   -bug (dkulp) Pinwheel effect was not producing data in Preview screen or on lights, it is fixed now
   -enh (sean) Move Effect 1 and Effect 2 into tabs  . This gives more space for the preview screen
   -enh (dpitts) Selected objects in the preview are yellow , not magenta
3.6.0   Nov 6,2014
   -enh (dpitts) NUTCRACKER and PREVIEW windows now use OpenGL to draw objects. The result of this is xLights can now draw very
      large objects with no delay.
   -enh (dpitts) New ability to load an image into the background of the PREVIEW tab. There is a brightness slider to dim the image you
      just loaded to give it a dusk time feel.
   -enh (dpitts) New ability to set the resolution of the PREVIEW screen. Set the size and it will be remembered. This is needed to
            help when making Whole House Models. This way you can always come back to the layout you had been working on.
   -enh (dpitts) You can now click and drag objects in the PREVIEW tab. If there are multiple objects under your mouse click multiple
      times and it will cycle through all of them
   -enh (dpitts) Now objects are sized and rotated about their graphical center, This means objects do not move around
      the screen if you resize or rotate.
   -enh (dpitts) New rotate handles. Grab the handle and move mouse to rotate. Highlighted model is now magenta insteads of yellow
   -enh (sean) Added Pinwheel effect
   -bug (dpitts) Model Brightness Now works
   -enh (dkulp) Allow star layers to be ordered low to high (to inside layer first)
   -bug (captmurdoch,materdaddy,dkulp) Modify make files and libraries so 3.6.0 can be compiled on MAC and on Linux
3.5.2   Oct 30,2014
   -bug (frankr) Fix for preview moving some elements into the wrong place. Before the ability to rotate any element
      rotations were in 3 degree increments, now they are 1 degree. This change caused existing previews to draw elements in
      a new position. New code detects old rotation or new rotation values and draws both correctly.
   -bug (frankr) Fixed issue related to  views when switching to new show folder. Under some circumstances, xlights would crash.
3.5.1   Oct 30, 2014
   -bug (dpitts) Found bug that causes crash. Single color models that have multiple lights (think 1 string of single color
      with 50 lights uses 1 channel, but draws 50 places) was not allocating memory correctly for each pseudo light.
   -enh (frankr) Ability added to preview screen, you now can rotate any object not just single string.
3.5.0   Oct 29, 2014
   -enh (dpitts) New button added to the preview screen. This will create a Whole House Model for you automatically.
      There is now a new type of model "Whole House". You no longer need to use spreadsheets and the custom model.
      Procedure: Layout your preview. When everything is correct, press "Create Whole House Model". Give it a name.
      This new whole house model should NOT have "Part of my Display" checked.
      Add the new whole house model as a column in your Nutcracker grid.
      enjoy the new feature, many thanks to Dave Pitts!!
   -bug (dkulp) fixed issue with Star model with users sequences that were older than Oct 20th. This was crashing
      xlights at launch time.
3.4.24   Oct 28, 2014
   -enh (dpitts) New feature to allow creating views. A view is a collection of models. When you select a view it acts
      like a filter and only shows you the models contained in your view. T
    -enh (dkulp) Star model can now have multiple star size “layers” to model exploding star type things
                     Example: a 100 node star may have 50 for the outer layer, 30 for the middle, 20 for the inner.
   -bug (djulien) Fixed multi-cell morph (caused Papagayo flicker), avoid error if try to save file with no pgo data
   -enh (sean) Increased custom model from 300x300 to 1000x1000
3.4.23   Oct 25, 2014
   -enh (sean) Added Ripple Effect Class
   -bug (sean) Recompiled entire rpoject , we believe a few modeuls were compiled with debug and that was
            causing the error message in the model screen. Since that recompile, we have not see the error
   -bug (djulien) Fixed up auto-fade arithmetic (morph flicker still occurs); fix pgo grid column label with presets > 4 voices
   -enh (djulien) Papgayo: Rework auto-rest options, insert rests between phonemes
3.4.22   Oct 23, 2014
   -enh (sean) Added new effect class "Shimmer". This effect is basically a square wave, it turns all lights on and then all
      lights off.
   -enh (sean) Removed FACES, COROFACES and PINWHEEL from the "Create Random Effects" button
   -enh (djulien) Change Pgo "auto fade element" to "auto rest" (not functional yet), leave initial Pgo Preset cleared for stitch
3.4.21   Oct 20, 2014
   -enh (djulien) Added model CSV export to the Models screen. This csv file can be opened by Excel or
      Open Office spreadsheets
3.4.20   Oct 19, 2014
   -enh (djulien) Added Papagayo Preset stitch (allows Presets to be combined dynamically at run time)
   NOTES:
    - Papagayo Presets match by model or voice name now rather than column#.  This means they can move around between columns and still work.
    - The format of the xlights_papagayo.xml file (where pgo Presets are stored) changed but should be backward-compatible.
    - Custom model info is cached with the Presets; if you change your Custom Models then re-Save the associated Presets
    - workflow for horizontal (side-by-side) stitch of multiple pgo files + presets is as follows:
      1. clear grid
      2. load first pgo file
      3. select corresponding Preset; this will "bind" the Preset info to the voice(s) in the pgo file
      4. load next pgo file using "+" button, specify "0" for #frames to shift
      5. select corresponding Preset
      6. select output file if not already set
      7. click button at the bottom to generate the sequence
      8. load additional pgo files as desired; for vertical stitch (concatenate) enter a non-0 value for #frames to shift
3.4.19   Oct 18, 2014
   -bug (djulien) Fixed Coro Faces render problem on models with > 26 columns, adjust text size on model zoom in/out, Papagayo Preset delete button
   -enh (djulien) Added Papagayo horizontal stitch (supports any number of voices within reason), accept 39 extended phonemes (auto-map to basic 10), removed duplicate phoneme in frame message (CAUTION: phonemes will be dropped with no warnings), added Preset consistency check, start making Model dialog resizable, show reason for "reseting flags" message
3.4.18   Oct 13,2014
   -enh (djulien) Merged Papagayo sub-tabs; implemented Image option (Movie option TBD); enabled fade on Auto faces; added Copy column button; flattened xlights_papagayo.xml file (old Presets still used for backwards compatibility, but new Presets are written a level higher and merged)
   -bug (djulien) Fixed Papagayo auto-fade; mostly works now, but there seems to still be some flicker (caused by something else within xLights)
   -enh (sean)    New effect class PinWheel. This is NOT working yet, it is a place holder.
3.4.17   Oct 8, 2014
   PRE-RELEASE. There are still bugs we are working in the corofaces code. One we know of , outline does not show in PREVIEW
   -enh (djulien) This release sees the Papagayo Tab for Corofaces working.
               To use this, choose a pgo file as input, choose a file for output.
               Choose your custom models from a pull down list. Be sure they have "Part of my Display" checked.
               Assign channels to Phonemes. You can assign multiple channels by doing ctl-click.
               Create an xml file of the pgo.
3.4.16   Oct 1, 2014
   -enh (djulien) Add zoom in/out buttons on Custom Model grid display (makes it easier to see larger grids)
   -enh (djulien) On Papagayo Coro faces tab, moved model name into grid, show drop-down list of choices in grid cells, allow Pagagayo file stitch ("+" button), add UI controls for face element auto-fade, save/restore last tab, show list of checkboxes in Coro Faces effect panel
3.4.15  Sep 28, 2014
   - ENH (Sean) merge_xml.awk will combine multiple xlights xml sequences into one.
   - ENH (Sean) corofaces.awk awk now will stitch together multiple files for the same voice.
3.4.14  Sep 26, 2014
   - ENH (Sean) scripts added that can take Papagayo voices and make xlights sequences from them
   - ENH (Sean) Scripts are found in your installation directory. corofaces.awk, coroface.bat

3.4.4   Jul 2, 2014
   -Bug (dkulp) Fix LOR Import
   The old XML parser, on the start element event, you could query if the element was empty or not.
   For the "channel" element, if it was empty, we skipped it and didn't map it to a channel.
   The new parser doesn't have that functionality.   I have to record some information at the start tag,
   determine if there are any effect child elements, and if not, undo some stuff at the end element.
   The detection and undo wasn't working properly.  Thus, any empty channels in the LMS were getting mapped.
   Why is this a problem?   Well, LMS has a habit of using extra channels for things.
   For example, the CCR's which have 50 pixels would normally just be 150 channels.
   However, in the LMS file, they are 157 channels.  I have no idea what the LR, MM, ME, CM, CS, and CI
   channels that it puts for each CCR are used for.
   In any case, those extra 7 channels (and any other empty channels) would cause large shifts.
   This release has changes to fix that.

   - Enhancement: (Matt Brown)  I made some improvements to countdown & skip blank cells logic. I also changed
      a couple of method names to make them more clear. Also, the timer now skips if the last interval takes more than 50ms to process.
      Before it was blocking until the last interval finished (so if every interval took more than 50ms you had a stackup of waiting timer calls to process).
3.1.0  Aug 7,2013
   - Enhancement: (frankr) new single BACKUP option now.
      Goto to "File,Backup" and every xml file you have will be created in the new Backup sub-directory under show show directory.
      How big are xLight sequences? The xseq file for 12K channels is around 30mbytes, the xml of your sequence is around 30kbytes. As comparison the XML file for LOR for the same song is 800mbytes, for LSP 1.2gbytes. Because xlight sequence files are so small (normally < 50kbytes), we can back them all up quickly.
      How long to back up over 100 sequences? < 1 second.
      How much space does 100 sequences take? < 10 mbytes
      How many times can you do this per day? 1000's.
      How to use this feature? Just do a "File, Backup" before getting new versions.
      I would do a copy if you plan on doing lots of edits.  Basically get yourself protected.
      So after upgrading to 3.1.0, go and make a copy before opening any sequences
   - Enhancement: (Matt Brown) re-engineered the underlying architecture. This is like replacing the galvanized pipe with copper pipe on your home. Takes lots of effort, when you are done the house still looks the same. This re-architecture was needed to allows us to offer new fit to time frame option. With this option effects will be enhanced to do things like start and end exactly to the timing marks on a row. Wait for future releases to see how this is going to help. Trust me, you will like the new things coming.
   - Enhancement: (Matt Brown) has enhanced the preview screen so it is multiple times brighter than before. So much nicer now!!
   - Enhancement: (frankr) made it so that when you select none, it will not overwrite existing data. Why do we care? This enhancement means a LSP person could sequence the first 30 seconds of a megatree (mark those rows as none,none in nutcracker). Now fill the rest of the sequence with nutcracker effects. The result? LSP effects will appear for the first 30 seconds, Nutcracker effects will appear for the remainder.
   - Enhancement:(Frankr) enhanced the right click process for protecting a cell. Before you had to get focus on the cell by left clicking (turned it yellow), then you could right click. Now just ricght click any cell, you dont need left click first
   - Enhancement: (Matt Brown) made it so effects are now listed alphabetically except for effects current under development (like the piano keyboard)
   - Enhancement: (sean) Sean added Radial 3d Button. Click this button besides the Radial button to get new radial effects
   - Bug Fix: (Sean, Matt, frankkr) . Found more division by zero errors, fixed them.
   - Enhancement: (Sean), For any  person who is pulling code and compiling it (Like MaterDaddy for Linux compiles). I have renamed repository nutcracker_c to be called xLights. Nutcracker_c was just a temp name I was using. I want everyone to remember we started with the xLights code base from Matt Brown in January of this  year. Nutcracker is just one tab on xllights. People get confused is it xLights? Is it Nutcracker? All of nutcracker has been put inside of xLights so the repository should be called the same. Again thanks to Matt for making this all possible. So here is new repository: https://github.com/smeighan/xLights
   - Enhancement: Please start to enter bugs into github so we can track them there. If you want to raise a bug go to https://github.com/smeighan/xLights/issues
   - Bug fix: (Matt) Meteors has been fixed by Matt's rewrite of the preview window. This means the normal Meteor effect is now working again.
      StarField still does not display on megatrees, it does work on other models.

        Audacity that will identify the polyphonic notes in a song.
   - Enhancement: (matt) Many changes to text. Ghosting is now fixed. You no longer have to use the temporary fix of using
      "1 is unmask, 2 is color wash". Text now has 45 degrees rotation. Countdown timer can show seconds counting down or
      it can show "xx d yy h zz m aa s" display. countdown text is now centered correctly.
   - Enhancement: (frankr) New effect for circles. Circles can bounce, collide. Choose radial to make a new effect
   - Bug Fix: (sean) fixed crash when creating random effects. The new effect classes (piano,circles) were causing problem. fixed
   - Bug Fix: (sean) When randomly creating Spirograph effects, the animate button was not being selected. fixed.
   - Enhancement: (frankr) Cells in your effect grid can now be protected/un-protected. Protect a cell and
      press the "create random effects" and all cells will get a new effect unless the cell is protected.
      Under Development: Piano Effect. This is NOT done yet. when completed it will animate a piano
      keyboard.
   - Enhancement: (frankr) Slider next to Layer choice. This slider allows you to pick how much of effect 1 and effect 2 show
      through.

      change. Now, you will be prompted if you want to save before exit.
   - Enhancement: (frankr) Random effect generation. When creating a Spirograph, the Animate button will always be set and the little radius will be
     set to its minimum value. By setting r to zero and setting animate to true, random spirographs will now always produce an animation.
   - Enhancement: (frankr) New choice in model generation. You can now select custom. We are not quite done with this but it will support having
     coro snowflakes, stars, strings wrapped around a car, fire sticks, candles,. Basically any model. Watch this space for a future tutorial.
